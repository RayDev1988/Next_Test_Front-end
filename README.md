# developer-experience-react-nextjs

This is the companion repo to my LogRocket post "The Developer Experience: Next.js vs React."

The project contains a React and a Next.js implmentation of a fun mini fan page for the Mandalorian. Season 2 comes out October 30!

To start the React project:

```bash
cd react
npm i
npm run start
```

To start the Next.js project:

```bash
cd nextjs
npm i
npm run dev
```
